<p class="reflect"> This quarter, we were introduced to CSS. Learning CSS is challenging as it is different from HTML. This markup language has features that HTML does not have. For example, HTML does not have selectors. Selectors are used to "find" or select the HTML elements you want to style. You have six selectors to choose from. <span class="me"> For me, I love using the class selector. </span> <br><br>

<div class="design"> CSS allows us to define styles for web pages, such as design, layout and variations in display. It supports improved efficiency and accessibility. It is essential for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, which provides an excellent viewing experience regardless of how users use the website. </div>
